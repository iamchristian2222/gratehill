Hello, if you are a grizzled veteran of the road and shared living spaces, or a newbie... 

We'd like to remind everyone that these ARE indeed, shared common spaces, that we keep a very close eye on(including cameras in common areas only)AND we constantly clean..w that being said, pls always clean up after yourself and always leave all spaces clean/tidy and FYI, we will know when you leave a mess.

We are very happy to host you ONLY if you read and agree to all of our House Rules including main points of interest like: 
- NO 3rd PARTY BOOKINGS! ‚Äãmeaning you cannot book for your friend nor relative, you can only book for yourself and other approved guests.
- DO NOT ARRIVE BEFORE 4PM UNLESS IT IS PREVIOUSLY ARRANGED!
- NO PETS
- NO SMOKING(Smoke only where the patio chairs are located or in your vehicle/street(although hanging out on or in the street is HIGHLY NOT SUGGESTED!)
- ABSOLUTELY NO VIDEOGRAPHY WHILE ON THE PROPERTY
- Keep spaces clean as they are found
-  No disturbances/loudness in the home with only declared/legitimate guests 

code word: grateful

**We also know when there are extra undeclared guests which is stealing BTW.

- ANY FORM OF DEMOSTIC VIOLENCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED- WE CALL 911!

   Please understand, if you agregiously break any of these rules, you will be asked to leave the home and your reservation will be cancelled with NO REFUND.
**The cops will also be called and we are not shy about that!

With all of that being said, we respectfully and humbly ask that you respond by email, first.
 
FOR US TO PROCEED, PLEASE RESPOND W HIDDEN CODE WORD and "I agree'.

**MUST PASS BACKGROUND CHECK FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL GUESTS!!!***
