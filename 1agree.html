     <p>Hello...and thanks for your time. Whether you are a grizzled veteran of the road and shared living spaces, or a newbie... 

We'd like to remind everyone that these ARE indeed, shared common spaces, and that we keep a very close eye on common areas only AND we constantly clean..
With that being said, pls always clean up after yourself and always leave all spaces clean/tidy. 
**FYI, we will know when you leave a mess.
<ul>
We are very happy to host you ONLY if you read and agree to all of our House Rules including main points of interest like:
